            <h3>Mern stack developer</h3>
            <p>Mern stack is a collection of technologies that
                enables faster application development. It is
                used by developers worldwide. The main purpose of
                using MERN stack is to develop apps using Java Script
                only. This is because the four technologies that make
                up the technology stack are all JS-based. Thus, if one
                knows JavaScript (and JSON), the backend, frontend,
                and database can be operated easily. </p>
